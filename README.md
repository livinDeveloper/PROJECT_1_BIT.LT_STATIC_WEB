### IMPROVED SKILLS IN:

	- HTML STRUCTURE
	- CSS POSITIONING
	- CSS FLOW MANAGEMENT
	- CSS FLEX
	- CSS CLASSes & IDs
	- CSS VARIABLES

### CHALLANGES:

	1. HAD A CHALLANGE WITH CSS STRUCTURE
		- NEEDED TO REWRITE A CODE FEW TIMES FOR CLASSES, IDs & POSIOTIONS TO SINK IN;
	2. AFTER MESSING AROUND WITH HTML STRUCTURE, STYLES STOPPED APPLING
		- WITH MENTOR'S HELP FOUND THAT </BODY> TAG WAS MISSING
	3. SOME CSS CLASSES DOESN'T APPLY OR ACT ODD TO/WITH HTML ELEMENTS
		- FOUND THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE A GLOBAL UNCOMMENTED EMPTY CLASSES
